            <p>
                Hello, everyone
                My name is Jingjun Han. I come from China. I have been here to study for 3 years. I am learning computer programming right now. I have taken EAP english course before
                I started my programming in Georgian college. As you can see, my English skill is not very well, but I am still keep doing on the english programm. When I finished my EAP
                courses, I started to learn computer programming. Well, I am not a good programmer. For the computer programming, I know nothing about that before. I have nothing knowledge
                about java, c#, java script, and so on. I am brand new about it. So there is my first time on that, and another bad point is that I learned it in English. For me, that is really
                bad, because I can promise I can do that really successfully if I learn it in Chinese. Therefore, I must spend a lot of time on the English and computer programming. Through the 
                a period of time to study, my computer skill and english skill got a little bit of improvement. However, I still need to keep doing on it to get more computer skills. This semester
                , I am leanring the course which is advanced web programming. Javascript and jQuery for me is very new. I have never learned that before, therefore, I am not really good at it. But,
                the best thing is that you give us Youtube list to review that in our home. That is super awesome, espically for our kind of international student, I need to see that 2 times one day at least.
                I like this very much. Thank you. I will do my best on this course.
